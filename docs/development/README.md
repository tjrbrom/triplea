# Developer Setup Guide

## Getting Started


* You'll need an IDE, IDEA or Eclipse and then [setup plugins and formatter](./ide-setup)

* Create a fork of triplea-game/triplea

* Clone your fork locally (be sure you are setup on github and 
  have an SSH key configured).
  
* Import the project into IDE, there are launchers checked-in to
  launch a game client
  
* Install Docker


## Next Steps

* [dev process & workflow](./dev-process)

* [code-conventions](./code-conventions)

* [pain points](./pain-points.md)

* [areas of need](./areas-of-need.md)
 
 
 ## Why Work on TripleA?
 
 * If you like the game and want to improve it
 * If you want to gain skill working with a legacy code base
  (refactoring, testing, safely making changes, techniques for migrating code)
 * To get practice coding and working within an open source team
 * To get better at specific technologies that are a fit and in-use by TripleA.
 
 If your goals align with those of TripleA, then this can be a really rewarding
 project! We will not lie about the frustration you can run into, and it's not
 easy, you will need to persevere and in the process will potentially grow and
 learn a lot.
