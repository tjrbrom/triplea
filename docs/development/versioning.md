# Versioning

Simplified 3 number versioning system based on semantic versioning:

``` compatibility.release.build_number```

- **compatibility** - Incremented when a new version is not backwards compatibility
- **Release** - A version number used by the TripleA team for version partitioning.
- **Build** - auto-generated by the build system.

For example, let's say 3.0.0 is current. If the team releases a new version, it would be '3.1.<build_number>'
If the next release version is not compatible, it would be '4.0.<build_number>'
Build number is an automatic number, it is ever increasing and is generated by Travis.
