/**
 * Unit Ability for targeting and causing damage to units
 *
 * <p>A unit ability indicates what targets a unit type has, what dice it should roll, whether its
 * casualties can return fire in a later {@link
 * games.strategy.engine.data.battle.phase.BattlePhase}.
 *
 * <p>Some examples of what this does cover are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Instant Kill for a Submarine: It would use the NORMAL dice type, its targets would be sea
 *       units, and casualties would not return fire.
 *   <li>Land Mines Explosion: It would use the NORMAL dice type, its targets would be land based,
 *       it would commit suicide, and the casualties would return fire.
 *   <li>Depth Charges for Destroyer: It would use the AA dice type, its targets would be
 *       submarines, and the casualties would return fire.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Some examples of what this doesn't cover are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The ability to blitz
 *   <li>The ability to retreat during a battle
 *   <li>The ability to create new units
 * </ul>
