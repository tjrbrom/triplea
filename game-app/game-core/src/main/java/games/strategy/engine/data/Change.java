/**
 * Not an interface because we want the perform() method to be protected. A Change encapsulates

 * to GameData as they occur. When a change is performed on a GameData in a game, the change is
 * serialized and sent across the network to all the clients. Since all changes to GameData are done
 * through changes and all changes are serialized to all clients, all clients should always be in
 * sync. A Change can be inverted to create an equal but opposite change. Use ChangeFactory to
 * create Changes.
