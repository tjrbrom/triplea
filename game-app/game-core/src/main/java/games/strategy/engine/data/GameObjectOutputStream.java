/**
 * To maintain == relationships and the singleton nature of many classes in GameData we do some work
 * in the ObjectSteam. For example, when we serialize a Territory over a GameObjectOutputStream, we
 * do not send an instance of Territory, but rather a marker saying that this is the territory, and
 * this is its name. When it comes time for a GameObjectOutputStream to read the territory on the
 * other side, the territory name is read, and the territory returned by the GameObjectInputStream
 * is the territory with that name belonging to the GameData associated with the
 * GameObjectInputStream. This ensures the state of the territory remains consistent.
