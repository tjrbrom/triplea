## java-extras

A sub-project for low level java utilities and helpers.
Essentially syntactic sugar for things that we wish were in `java.lang`.

### Sub-Project Scope

Should contain helper APIs and utilities that depend only on things
like: java.lang, guava, org.apache.commons.

Please try to keep this sub-project minimized to what is low-level and widespread
common. Prefer purpose-specific sub-projects for grouping utilities where possible.
It would be easy for this sub-project to become overconsuming and begin
to contain 'everything'.
